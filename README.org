* Usage of new jug code: 
  ```python
  jug execute  experiments/save_sweep.py -- --debug with log_dir=/path/to/experiment N_train=40 N_test=20 model=Myrtle10_split_cpu seed=848335
  ```

  Works. The `--debug` option is important because it prevents Sacred from
  catching exceptions and disrupting the functioning of `jug.barrier`.
  
* List of TODOs 
** TODO Replace sacred by another argument parsing system
   `sacred` is now just a glorified argument parser for the `save_sweep.py`
   experiment. I've replaced its log-dir creation functionality and storing of
   the current code source, in the `log_dir_hook` function of
   `cnn_limits/sacred_utils.py`.
   
** TODO prevent re-compilation of the jax_model for every task 
   Since you can't pickle a Python function, I thought you can't have it as
   output of the task
