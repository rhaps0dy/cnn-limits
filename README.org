* Correlated Weights in Infinite Limits of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

Code for the UAI 2021 paper [Correlated weights in infinite limits of deep convolutional neural networks](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v161/garriga-alonso21a.html)


** Usage of new jug code: 
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   # Env variables for jax
   export JAX_ENABLE_X64=True 
   export XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false 
   jug execute experiments/save_sweep.py with i_SU.log_dir=/path/to/experiment \
       N_train=40 N_test=20 model=Myrtle10_split_cpu seed=848335
 #+END_SRC

 Sacred is just an argument parser now.
*** TODO ensure there are no problems with storing many large kernel matrices in memory
   in particular I'm uneasy about the ~save_hdf5~ function in
   ~experiments/save_sweep.py~.
